## Leetcode Editorial Screenshots are under the [editorial-screenshots](https://github.com/akhilkammila/leetcode-screenshotter/tree/main/editorial-screenshots) folder
Note that leetcode does not have editorials for every problem. About half the problems have editorials.

## Leetcode Problem Screenshots (including premium problems) are under the [problem-screenshots](https://github.com/akhilkammila/leetcode-screenshotter/tree/main/problem-screenshots) folder

## About
This project contains screenshots of all editorials and problems. Editorials are extremely helpful, and explain how to do each problem in multiple ways â€“ but they are premium-only. Most problems are free, but some are premium-only.

I am done working on this project, but if there is interest, like 100 stars or something, I might do more.
Some things I could do:
* Screenshot the editorials for multiple languages (C++, Java, Python) instead of just C++
* Make sure that the code in the editorials is fully shown (sometimes it is hidden by scroll)
* Screenshot the starting code for problems
* Update regularly to include new problems
If you want a feature, open an Issue, and if there is interest I might do it.

## Helping and Reporting Issues
If you are interested in contributing, or just have questions, reach out to me.

If there are issues such as:
* Blurry Images
* Improperly Cropped Images
* Problems that I skipped over
Please open an Issue and tell me
